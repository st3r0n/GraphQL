use InQL,  GraphQL visualizer,Clairvoyance tools to visualize or find comlete kist f queries available
we can use inql to see available functions and quesries and then copy them in out port request in graphql tab
LOOK FOR IDOR vulns

use query{__schema}    -----> for introspection

{
        "query": "{__schema{queryType{name}}}"
    }
}


TRY to change  get to POST or content type from json to x-www-form-urlencoded

BYPASSING GRAPHQL DEFENCED -----> either use above methods or 

You should try characters like spaces, new lines and commas, as they are ignored by GraphQL but not by flawed regex or we can use 
{
        "query": "query{__schema
        {queryType{name}}}"
    }
    like this where schema{ may be blacklisted but above will work
